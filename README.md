  ## Description
  For this assignment, I created a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

  ## User Story
  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

  ## Technologies
  handlebars, html, css, javascript, mySQL, mySQL workbench, JawsDB, Heroku, Express
